# ✈️ Airline Operations Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs an end-to-end exploratory and analytical study of airline operations, focusing on flight delays, cancellations, airline performance, airport congestion, and traffic patterns.

Using Python and data analysis libraries, the project extracts actionable insights that help understand:

- Which airlines are most reliable  
- Which airports experience the highest delays  
- How delays vary by time and route  
- Major reasons behind flight cancellations  

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze arrival and departure delays  
- Identify on-time vs delayed airline performance  
- Study flight cancellations and their reasons  
- Understand the traffic trends  

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains commercial flight records of USA for the year 2015 with the following key attributes:

- Flight Date (Year, Month, Day)  
- Airline Codes (IATA)  
- Origin & Destination Airports  
- Scheduled and Actual Times  
- Arrival & Departure Delays  
- Cancellation Status and Reasons  
- Distance Travelled  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

### Programming & Libraries
- **Python**
- **pandas** – data manipulation  
- **numpy** – numerical operations  
- **matplotlib** – static visualizations 

---

## 🔄 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Key preprocessing steps include:

- Converting Month Number to Month Name Column  
- Extracting hour of day from scheduled times  
- Handling:
  - NaN / None / NaT values  
  - Empty and whitespace strings  
- Selective row removal (`dropna(subset=...)`)  
- Standardizing month order using categorical data  
- Creating derived metrics (on-time %, cancellation rate)  

----

## 📈 Key Analyses Performed

### 1️⃣ Delay Analysis
- Median Arrival Delay by Airline  
- Median Departure Delay by Hour of Day  
- Monthly Delay Trends  
- Distance vs Delay Scatter Analysis  

### 2️⃣ Cancellation Analysis
- Cancellation Rate by Airline  
- Cancellation Reasons Distribution  
- Cancellations by Hour of Day  
- Impact of Cancellations on Delay Metrics  

### 3️⃣ Airline Performance
- On-time performance percentage  
- Worst and best performing airlines  
- Delay consistency across time slots  

### 4️⃣ Airport & Route Insights
- Busiest airports by flight volume  
- Most congested destination airports  
- Routes with highest air traffic  

---

## 📊 Visualizations Created

- Line charts (hourly and monthly trends)  
- Bar and horizontal bar charts  
- Histograms (delay distributions)  
- Scatter plots (distance vs delay)  
- Pie charts (cancellation reasons)  
- Area charts (monthly traffic trends)  

All charts are:
- Cleaned of clutter (spines removed)  
- Properly labeled  
- Scaled for readability  

---


Enables:
- Interactive filtering (Airline, Month, Airport)  
- Drill-downs  
- Cross-highlighting  
- Executive-ready dashboards  

## ✅ Key Business Insights (Example)

- Certain airlines consistently maintain lower median delays  
- Peak delays occur during late evening hours  
- Summer months show higher flight volume and congestion  
- Weather-related cancellations dominate over technical issues  
- High-traffic routes do not always have the highest delays  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Predictive delay modeling using ML  
- Weather data integration  
- Route-level optimization analysis  
- Real-time dashboarding  
- Automated data quality checks
